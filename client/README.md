# üîç Scam Link Scanner ‚Äì Real vs Fake Link Detector

The Scam Link Scanner is a simple tool built using **React and Express.js**. It helps users scan any link to see if it's **safe** or potentially **scam/phishing**. It simulates a professional 10-second scanning process, then shows whether the link is suspicious or safe using a preview card and smart keyword detection.

## üìå Features

- ‚è≥ 10-second fake scanning countdown to look realistic  
- üö´ Blocks links pretending to be WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, etc.  
- ‚úÖ Shows preview with title, image, and description for valid links  
- üîç Smart keyword detection for phishing-like words (`verify`, `login`, `support`, etc.)  
- üìÉ Clean UI with Bootstrap and CSS styling

## üíª How to Run the Project (Step by Step)

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scam-link-scanner.git
cd scam-link-scanner
````

---

### 2. Setup the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### (Optional) Add Link Preview API Key

If you want to use a real preview (image/title) for links, get your API key from [https://www.linkpreview.net](https://www.linkpreview.net) and update it in `check-url.js`:

```js
const apiKey = 'your_linkpreview_api_key';
```

Then start the backend:

```bash
node index.js
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

---

### 3. Setup the Frontend

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

## üß† How It Works

1. User pastes a link in the scanner.
2. A 10-second countdown simulates scanning.
3. The backend checks:

   * If the link contains suspicious keywords (e.g., `verify`, `support`, `login`)
   * If the domain is pretending to be Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.
   * If it's listed in the `harmfullinks.js` file
4. Based on result:

   * ‚úÖ Shows preview and working "Visit Link" button if safe
   * ‚ùå Blocks access and shows warning if it seems scammy

## üîê Example Links and What Happens

| Link                                          | Result |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `https://facebook.com`                        | ‚úÖ Safe |
| `https://login-facebook-verification.xyz`     | ‚ùå Scam |
| `https://verify-instagram-login.freehost.com` | ‚ùå Scam |
| `https://www.instagram.com`                   | ‚úÖ Safe |
| `https://wa-support-help-login.com`           | ‚ùå Scam |

You can add your own fake domains in `harmfullinks.js` for testing.

## ‚ùì FAQ ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is this project for?

It helps people check if a link is real or fake, especially to avoid phishing websites.

### 2. Why does it take 10 seconds to scan?

That‚Äôs a fake countdown to make it feel professional, like antivirus software.

### 3. Can I add my own fake/scam links?

Yes! Just edit `harmfullinks.js` and add any domains or keywords you want to block.

### 4. What happens after the scan?

You either get a warning (if the link is fake) or a nice preview card (if it‚Äôs safe).

### 5. Why are real Facebook/Instagram links allowed?

Because we only block fake versions. The real domains are safe.

### 6. How does it know a link is fake?

It checks:

* Known scam keywords (like `verify`, `support`, `login`)
* Tricky domain names that mimic real ones
* A custom list of scam links

### 7. Can I change the 10-second scan time?

Yes! In the frontend code (`ScanResult.jsx`), find the `setTimeout` and update the time.

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  // do something
}, 10000); // 10 seconds
```

### 8. Can I use this on my phone?

Yes! It works on both desktop and mobile.

### 9. Does it collect or save my data?

Nope. This is a front-end demo app. No user data is stored.

### 10. Why isn‚Äôt my link showing a preview?

You need a LinkPreview API key. Go to [linkpreview.net](https://www.linkpreview.net), get a free key, and add it to `check-url.js`.

### 11. Can this be turned into a browser extension?

Yes, with more work this logic could be ported into an extension.

### 12. Can I share this with friends or teachers?

Absolutely! It's safe and fun to use.

### 13. What skills do I need to build this?

Basic knowledge of JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

### 14. Can this detect all scams?

No, it‚Äôs just a basic scanner. Real scammers use tricks that need advanced detection (like AI or threat databases).

### 15. Can I contribute to this project?

Yes! Fork the repo, make changes, and create a pull request.
